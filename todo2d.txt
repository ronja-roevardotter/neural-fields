Basically nothing is done for the 2-dimensional model except for the integration & stability analysis (with and without adaptation). 
The following points are just first thoughts of what has to be done:

    - pattern recognition
        -> adjust the thresholds that determine whether it is a bump-solution or a spatiotemporal pattern
        -> other option: make sure, that the images compared underlie always the same time-interval (always 10 images for the last second or so)
    - coarse vs. fine discretization 
        -> what it the minimal discretization necessary to avoid discretization effects?
        -> kernel-size in relation to sheet-size
    - research
        -> what have others found under which circumstances?
        -> how did they analyse it?
        -> pattern detection (Roberts et al, Townsend et al, ...)
    
    - [...]
    - delays
    - noise
    - shape, size, units of sheet
    - boundary conditions
    - heterogeneous connectivity profile
