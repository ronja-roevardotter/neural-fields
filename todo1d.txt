Generally - a lot has been done and is fully working. The following points are not to be forgotten though:

    - boundary conditions, i.e. line instead of ring-architecture
    - heterogeneous connectivity profile?
    - Ih-current instead of adaptation for SOs? (see, Levenstein et al 2024)
    - traveling wave-solutions? (see, Coombes 2005)
    - classification if limit cycles 
    - loss of stability for polynomial inequalities (e.g. c1c2>c0 for this and that condition....)
    - noise
    - get rid of computations inside of toy-notebooks!
    - simplify call for csv-files for the same visualisation in adaps-toy-notebook
    - include everything you've done in your ParameterExploration.tex for documentation including methods- and pipeline details
    - clean up csv-file-chaos
    - clean-up notebook-chaos
    - clean, and detailed delay-testing + feature extraction
    - order of delays should make more sense! It's confusing as it is right now.
